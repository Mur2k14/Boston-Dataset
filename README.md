# Boston-Dataset
This project is all about predicting the rent of a house in a specific area. It takes into account a lot of factors which influence the rent 
of the property. The boston dataset will help us in predicting the rent of a house (The data points in the dataset are collected from the boston area 
and using Regression we are predicting the rent). The difference between prediction between Linear regression and polynomial regression is shown in the dataset
with Polynomial regression clearly emerging as the better model.
